        "I have always felt an affinity for logic and problem solving and this is what pulled me towards the field of Computer Science. It started with a Logo program, then it was a C program, then it was Algorithms and then much more. Fast forward to today and I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at University of Virginia. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and two years of work experience as a Software Developer.",
        "I am really interested in Full stack development and have been working on projects using Angular and Django. The programming language I have highly used in the past year is Python but I have also worked with Java and C++. I also have experience with Oracle and PostgreSQL and I am always up for learning new tools and languages.",
        "I want to make a difference where I work. In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, taking long walks and sometimes sketching."
